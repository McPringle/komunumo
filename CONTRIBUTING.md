## How to contribute

### Project Board

To get an overview of ongoing and upcoming work, you can check our [project board](https://github.com/users/McPringle/projects/8/views/1), which organizes issues in a Kanban-style workflow:

| Status      | Description                                                   |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Backlog     | Ideas and requests that are not yet analyzed.                 |
| In Analysis | Issues currently under discussion or refinement.              |
| Ready       | Issues that are fully specified and ready to be implemented.  |
| In Progress | Issues actively being worked on.                              |
| Done        | Recently completed issues; older ones are archived over time. |

> [!TIP]
> If youâ€™re looking for something to work on, focus on issues in the **Ready** column. These contain all necessary information to start contributing right away.

### Good first issues

To find possible tasks for your first contribution to *Komunumo*, we tagged some of the hopefully easier to solve issues as [good first issue](https://github.com/McPringle/komunumo/labels/good%20first%20issue).

If you prefer to meet people in real life to contribute to *Komunumo* together, we recommend to visit a [Hackergarten](https://www.hackergarten.net/) event. *Komunumo* is often selected as a contribution target in [Lucerne](https://www.meetup.com/hackergarten-luzern/), [Zurich](https://www.meetup.com/hackergarten-zurich/), and at the [CyberLand Open Source Camp](https://cyberland.ijug.eu/).

Please join our developer community using our [Matrix chat](#matrix-chat) to get support and help for contributing to *Komunumo*.

### Commit Messages

Please follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for all commit messages. This structured format helps automate changelogs, release processes, and code reviews.

For *Komunumo*, we love to add the issue number to the end of the commit message. This helps to track the changes in the code and the issue tracker. When the commit closes an issue, the `closes`, `fixes`, or `resolves` keyword can be used. This will automatically close the issue when the commit is merged into the main branch.

A commit message consists of the following parts:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <short description> [optional keyword] #<issue number>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

#### Examples

- `feat: add support for passkey authentication closes #123`
- `fix(event): correct date formatting in export fixes #456`
- `chore: add missing license headers to source files resolves #789`

#### Common `type` values:

| Type       | Purpose                                                               |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `feat`     | Introduce a new feature                                               |
| `fix`      | Fix a bug                                                             |
| `docs`     | Documentation-only changes                                            |
| `style`    | Code style changes (formatting, whitespace, missing semicolons, etc.) |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring without functional change                            |
| `perf`     | Improve performance without changing features or behavior             |
| `test`     | Add or update tests                                                   |
| `build`    | Changes to the build system, packaging or dependencies (e.g. Maven)   |
| `ci`       | Changes to CI/CD configuration (e.g. GitHub Actions, Woodpecker)      |

### Sign-off your commits

It is important to sign-off *every* commit. That is a de facto standard way to ensure that *you* have the right to submit your content and that you agree to the [DCO](DCO.md) (Developer Certificate of Origin).

You can find more information about why this is important and how to do it easily in a very good [blog post](https://dev.to/janderssonse/git-signoff-and-signing-like-a-champ-41f3)  by Josef Andersson.

### AI generated code

AI generated source code is based on real existing source code, which is copied in whole or in part into the generated code. The license of the original source code with which the AI was trained is not taken into account. It is not clear which license conditions apply and how these can be complied with. For legal reasons, we therefore do not allow AI-generated source code at all.

### Testing

#### Assertions

*Komunumo* uses [AssertJ](https://assertj.github.io/doc/) for writing assertions in unit tests. To ensure consistency, readability, and rich failure messages, only AssertJ should be used for all assertions. The use of JUnit's built-in `assert*` methods and Hamcrest matchers is explicitly disallowed and enforced through architecture tests. This includes, but is not limited to:

- `org.junit.Assert`
- `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions`
- `org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert`

Instead, use AssertJ's fluent assertion style, for example:

```java
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected);

assertThat(collection).containsExactly("one", "two");

assertThatThrownBy(() -> service.doSomethingBad())
    .isInstanceOf(IllegalArgumentException.class);
```

#### Integration Tests

All **integration** tests must extend the abstract `IntegrationTest` or `BrowserTest` base class. This ensures consistent configuration of the Spring Boot context, dependency injection, and database setup across all integration tests. Extend from the `IntegrationTest` class for tests that do not require a browser using [Karibu Testing](https://github.com/mvysny/karibu-testing), or from the `BrowserTest` class for tests that need to interact with the UI in a browser environment using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

Do not annotate integration tests manually with `@SpringBootTest`, `@Transactional`, or other Spring annotations. This is already handled by the base class. The base classes also provide shared utilities and guarantees a controlled test environment. All integration test classes should be named with the `IT` suffix to distinguish them from unit tests.

Example:

```java
class UserServiceIT extends IntegrationTest {

    @Autowired
    private UserService userService;

    @Test
    void shouldReturnUserByEmail() {
        final var user = userService.findByEmail("demo@example.eu");
        assertThat(user).isPresent();
    }
}

```

> [!WARNING]
> Integration tests that do not extend `IntegrationTest` or `BrowserTest` may not run correctly or may produce unforeseen errors.

### Pull Request Scope

Please make sure that each pull request is focused on a single issue or change. Avoid bundling unrelated modifications together in the same PR, as this makes the review process harder and slows down merging. If you want to contribute multiple independent changes, submit them as separate pull requests so they can be reviewed and merged individually.

> [!NOTE]  
> GitHub only allows one pull request per branch. To open multiple pull requests, you need to create a separate branch for each change.

## Quickstart for Local Development

This guide helps you get *Komunumo* up and running on your local machine for development purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed:

- Git
- Java LTS (currently version 21) - check with `java -version`
- Podman or Docker

### Clone and Verify

1. Fork the [Komunumo repository](https://github.com/McPringle/komunumo) on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/komunumo.git
   cd komunumo
   ```

3. Run all tests to verify that everything works:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw verify
   ```

### Start Required Services

*Komunumo* needs a database and a mail server to run. For local development, you can start both using a helper script:

```bash
cd ./dev-tools
./runServices
```

This script starts the following containers using Podman or Docker (whichever is available):

- MariaDB on Port 3306 with persistent data in `mariadb-data`.  
  The database user will be `komunumo` with the password `komunumo`. The database name is also `komunumo`.
- Adminer (database web UI) on port [4000](http://localhost:4000/)
- Mailpit (SMTP server) on port 1025, web UI on port [8025](http://localhost:8025), persistent data in `mailpit-data`

**Important:** This setup is for development only and not suitable for production use.

#### Adminer Login Information

| Field    | Value           |
|----------|-----------------|
| System   | MySQL / MariaDB |
| Server   | mariadb         |
| User     | komunumo        |
| Password | komunumo        |
| Database | komunumo        |

After starting the script, logs will be shown. To stop the services, press `Ctrl+C`. This stops all containers as well.

### Configure Environment Variables

*Komunumo* is configured using environment variables. At minimum, the following must be set:

```env
KOMUNUMO_INSTANCE_ADMIN=root@localhost
KOMUNUMO_DB_URL=jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/komunumo?serverTimezone=Europe/Zurich&allowMultiQueries=true
KOMUNUMO_DB_USER=komunumo
KOMUNUMO_DB_PASS=komunumo
KOMUNUMO_DEMO_ENABLED=true
KOMUNUMO_MAIL_HOST=localhost
KOMUNUMO_MAIL_PORT=1025
```

> [!WARNING]
> When demo mode is enabled (`KOMUNUMO_DEMO_ENABLED=true`), any data entered will be deleted at each start of the server and at the top of every hour! This ensures a consistent state for repeated testing and demonstrations.


If you're in a different timezone, adjust the `serverTimezone` parameter accordingly.
You can define these variables via your IDE, or directly in your shell.

### Run Komunumo

You can run *Komunumo* either via your IDE or the command line. On the command line, use the Maven Wrapper:

```bash
./mvnw
```

This runs the `app.komunumo.Application` main class.

### Open in Browser

Once the application is running, open your browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:8080/

Make sure JavaScript is enabled.

### Stop Komunumo

- In your IDE: use the stop button
- In the terminal: press `Ctrl+C`

## Communication

### Matrix Chat

There is a channel at Matrix for quick and easy communication. This is publicly accessible for everyone. For developers as well as users. The communication in this chat is to be regarded as short-lived and has no documentary character.

You can find our Matrix channel here: [@komunumo:ijug.eu](https://matrix.to/#/%23komunumo:ijug.eu)

### GitHub Discussions

We use the corresponding GitHub function for discussions. The discussions held here are long-lived and divided into categories for the sake of clarity. One important category, for example, is that for questions and answers.

## Architecture

The server of *Komunumo* is written using the [Java programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)). The main framework is [Spring](https://spring.io/). For the user interface, we use [Vaadin Flow](https://vaadin.com/flow). To access the database, we rely on [jOOQ](https://www.jooq.org/). To coordinate the build process, [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is used.

### Structure

Vaadin web applications are full-stack and include both client-side and server-side code in the same project.

| Directory                                  | Description                                 |
|:-------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| `src/main/frontend/`                       | Client-side source directory                |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`index.html`       | HTML template                               |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`index.ts`         | Frontend entrypoint                         |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`main-layout.ts`   | Main layout Web Component (optional)        |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`views/`           | UI views Web Components (TypeScript / HTML) |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`styles/`          | Styles directory (CSS)                      |
| `src/main/java/app/komunumo/`              | Server-side source directory                |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Application.java` | Server entrypoint                           |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`AppShell.java`    | application-shell configuration             |

## Database

### General Principles

- **Database independence**: All schema definitions must be compatible with common SQL databases. Avoid vendor-specific features unless absolutely necessary.
- **Schema migrations**: Use [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) for schema versioning. Each migration must have a clearly written description and follow our naming convention.
- **Identifier generation**: Always use application-generated IDs (e.g., UUIDs) instead of `AUTO_INCREMENT`, `SERIAL`, or database sequences to ensure cross-database compatibility.
- **Primary key constraints**: Primary key constraints should **not** have explicit names; let the database assign a default name to avoid conflicts across different environments.
- **Timestamps**: Use `TIMESTAMP` instead of `DATETIME` to ensure consistent handling of time zones and better cross-database support.
- **Enum usage**: Use Java `enum` types mapped via jOOQ converters to `VARCHAR` columns in the database. Do **not** reference enum values from lookup tables.
- **DTO mapping**: All database access must go through the service layer. Records returned by jOOQ must be converted to DTOs in a dedicated mapping layer.
- **Referential Integrity**: Use foreign key constraints to ensure referential integrity where appropriate.
- **Optional Fields**: If a field is optional, make sure the database column is nullable and check for `null` explicitly in the application logic.

### Index Names

List of prefixes for index names:

| Prefix | Used For     | Example            |
|--------|--------------|--------------------|
| `uk_`  | Unique Key   | `uk_group_profile` |
| `fk_`  | Foreign Key  | `fk_event_group`   |
| `idx_` | Normal Index | `idx_event_begin`  |

Primary keys don't have a name and therefore no prefix!

### Starting a Local MariaDB Instance

To start a local MariaDB instance using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/), you can use the provided scripts:

- `runMariaDB` (for Linux, BSD, and macOS)
- `runMariaDB` (for Windows)

These scripts will automatically detect whether `podman` or `docker` is available and use the appropriate tool. If neither is installed, an error message will be shown. The database is started using `compose` and will run in the foreground showing the logs. The container will be removed when MariaDB is stopped (e.g. using the `CTRL`+`C` shortcut).  All data will be persisted in the directory `.mariadb/data`. These scripts are meant for local development purposes only! Don't use them in production!

## Build

### Maven

*Komunumo* uses [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to build the project. Please use standard Maven commands to build what you need:

| Command          | What it does                                                      |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `./mvnw`         | compile and run the app                                           |
| `./mvnw clean`   | cleanup generated files and build artefacts                       |
| `./mvnw compile` | compile the code without running the tests                        |
| `./mvnw test`    | compile and run all tests                                         |
| `./mvnw package` | compile, test, and create a JAR file to run it with Java directly |
| `./mvnw verify`  | compile, test, package, and run analysis tools                    |

There is *no need* to run the `install` or `deploy` tasks. They will just run longer, produce unnecessary output, burn energy, and occupy your disk space. [Don't just blindly run mvn clean install...](https://www.andreaseisele.com/posts/mvn-clean-install/)

## Running and debugging

There are two ways to run the application: From the command line or directly from your IDE.

### Running the server from the command line.

To run from the command line, use `./mvnw` and open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

### Running and debugging the server in Intellij IDEA

#### Using Maven

- On the right side of the window, select "Maven" --> "Plugins" --> `spring-boot` --> `spring-boot:run`
- Optionally, you can disable tests by clicking on a `Skip Tests mode` blue button.

After the server has started, you can view it at http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
You can now also attach breakpoints in code for debugging purposes, by clicking next to a line number in any source file.

#### Using the main method

- Locate the `Application.java` class in the Project view. It is in the `src` folder, under the main package's root.
- Right-click on the Application class
- Select "Debug 'Application.main()'" from the list

After the server has started, you can view it at http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
You can now also attach breakpoints in code for debugging purposes, by clicking next to a line number in any source file.

### Running and debugging the server in Eclipse

#### Using Maven

- Right click on a project folder and select `Run As` --> `Maven build...`. After that a configuration window is opened.
- In the window set the value of the **Goals** field to `spring-boot:run`
- You can optionally select the `Skip tests` checkbox
- All the other settings can be left to default

Once configurations are set clicking `Run` will start the application.

Do not worry if the debugger breaks at a `SilentExitException`. This is a Spring Boot feature and happens on every startup.

After the server has started, you can view it at http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
You can now also attach breakpoints in code for debugging purposes, by clicking next to a line number in any source file.

#### Using the main method

- Locate the `Application.java` class in the Package Explorer. It is in `src/main/java`, under the main package.
- Right-click on the file and select `Debug As` --> `Java Application`.

Do not worry if the debugger breaks at a `SilentExitException`. This is a Spring Boot feature and happens on every startup.

After the server has started, you can view it at http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
You can now also attach breakpoints in code for debugging purposes, by clicking next to a line number in any source file.

## Running using Docker

> [!TIP]
> There is an [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mcpringle/komunumo/general) you can use to run *Komunumo*.

To build the dockerized version of *Komunumo* yourself, run:

```
docker build . -t komunumo:latest
```

Once the Docker image is correctly built, you can test it locally using:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 komunumo:latest
```
